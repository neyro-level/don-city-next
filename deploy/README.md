# Internal production deploy

Target: `start-baza.ams24.ru`.

This folder contains only non-secret deployment templates. Runtime values must be
materialized into `/etc/ams/realtbase/start-baza.env` on the server. Do not
commit or paste secret values. For this starter deployment, the owner-approved
database is local PostgreSQL on AMS Server, not a paid Timeweb Managed
PostgreSQL instance.

Release shape:

1. Build immutable image from exact SourceCraft `main` SHA outside the production
   host.
2. Run Payload migrations from the same image before rollout.
3. Start one runtime through `deploy/compose/start-baza.compose.yml`.
4. Keep `JOBS_AUTORUN=false` during initial smoke; enable exactly one jobs owner
   only after the old owner is confirmed inactive.
5. Proxy `start-baza.ams24.ru` through the Nginx template with `X-Robots-Tag:
   noindex, nofollow` until the owner promotes the instance.

Rollback: switch `AMS_REALTBASE_IMAGE` back to the previous known-good immutable
tag and restart the compose project. Database rollback is separate and requires
restore evidence before destructive changes. Local PostgreSQL backups live
outside the app container and must be protected by server backup policy.

The client clone reference is separate: `deploy/clients/timeweb/README.md`.
It does not change this starter demo topology and contains no live credentials.
